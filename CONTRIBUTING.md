[Github issues](https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil-cli/issues), or our
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bigcommerce) tag.

### Pull Requests

-   Fill in [the required template](https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil-cli/pull/new/master)
-   Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
-   End files with a newline.

### Release stencil-cli

In order to release stencil-cli you should create a release PR to master branch with updated `CHANGELOG.md` and versions. After PR is merged, you should go to https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil-cli/releases/new, create a tag and describe the release. Click `Publish` and Github Actions will publish new version to npm.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

-   Commit message should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) structure
-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
-   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
-   Reference pull requests and external links liberally

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JS code must adhere to [AirBnB Javascript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript),
except rules overridden in our .eslintrc.

Additionally:

-   Prefer async/await to callbacks.
-   Class dependencies with side effects (e.g. "fs" has side effects, "lodash" - hasn't) should be
    explicitly passed to the constructor so that they can be easily mocked in unit tests.
-   Mark private class fields and methods with an underscore (e.g. user.\_password) and @private JSDoc tag
    and avoid using them in other entities (while our current Node version doesn't support native private fields).

### Project best practices

**CLI commands:**

Entry point is located at `/bin`. The file with entry point should only read the CLI arguments and
call a corresponding CLI-command-class with the implementation located at `/lib`. CLI-command-class uses
dependency injection throughout constructor, the main method runs other methods-tasks. Tasks are aimed to be pure and
use context (this) only for external dependencies (logger, fs, etc).

Shared logic and tasks should be moved out from the CLI-command-classes to separate service classes.

E.g.: [stencil-init](/bin/stencil-init).

**Local server:**

Hapi server plugins located at `/server/plugins` should have controller logic only. Business logic should be moved out to
common entities located at `/lib`.
