Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number
```

Run `stencil init` at the top level of your Stencil Theme. It will ask you a few questions to get your started.

Run `stencil start` to run a local server so you can start developing your theme.

Run with `-o` or `--open` to automatically open up a browser.

-   While stencil is running, you can type "rs" and then hit enter to auto-reload all browsers. This is similar to
    Nodemon's rs option.

Run `stencil bundle` to validate your code and create a zip bundle file that can be uploaded to BigCommerce.

Run `stencil release` to tag a new version of your theme, create a [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/)
in your theme repository, and upload the zip bundle file to the release assets.
This is useful for tracking your changes in your Theme, and is the tool we use to create new releases in BigCommerce
[Cornerstone](https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil) theme.

Run `stencil push` to bundle the local theme and upload it to your store, so it will be available in My Themes.
To push the theme and also activate it, use `stencil push -a`. To automatically delete the oldest theme if you are at
your theme limit, use `stencil push -d`. These can be used together, as `stencil push -a -d`. You can apply the theme to
multiple storefronts, just specify ids of desired storefronts/channels after `-c` option `stencil push -a -c 123 456 789`.
If you want to apply theme to all available storefronts, just use `-allc` option: `stencil push -a -allc`.

Run `stencil pull` to sync changes to your theme configuration from your live store. For example, if Page Builder has
been used to change certain theme settings, this will update those settings in config.json in your theme files so you
don't overwrite them on your next upload.

Run `stencil debug` to get information about runtime environment and the configuration

## Features

### BrowserSync

Stencil CLI comes packaged with BrowserSync so you can take advantage of all of those amazing goodies!
Have a look at their [web site](http://www.browsersync.io/) for more information.

### Sass compiling

You can compile Sass (node-sass) scss files in assets/scss into CSS. For example, add an scss file named theme.scss
to assets/scss and `{{{stylesheet 'assets/css/theme.css'}}}` to your theme HTML template. Stencil-CLI will compile
assets/scss/theme.scss to CSS on the fly.

### Autoprefixer

Stencil CLI comes packaged with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). You can set which browsers
should be targeted, as well as if it should cascade the generated rules in the theme's config.json file with these
options:

-   `autoprefixer_cascade` - Defaults to `true`.
-   `autoprefixer_browsers` - Defaults to `["> 1%", "last 2 versions", "Firefox ESR"]`.

## Running in docker

There is possibility to run stencil-cli in docker.
Here are steps to have this functionality.

First, pull the image from Github Packages (docker registry):
`docker pull ghcr.io/bigcommerce/stencil-cli`

Then, you want to run some commands against your theme.

For example
`docker run -p 3005:3005 -v /bigcommerce/cornerstone:/usr/src/app -it ghcr.io/bigcommerce/stencil-cli stencil init`, where `3005` is port number definded in `config.stencil.json` and `/bigcommerce/cornerstone` path to where theme is located.

`docker run -p 3005:3005 -v /bigcommerce/cornerstone:/usr/src/app -it ghcr.io/bigcommerce/stencil-cli stencil start` and so on
